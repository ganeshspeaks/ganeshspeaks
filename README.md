- <> Hi, I'm Ganesh Kumar </>

I don’t chase job titles.  
I build what I believe in. Break what I must. Learn what I love. Repeat.

## Right now
- Learning system design — not from YouTube slides, but by breaking things until they make sense  
- Digging into cyber security — because I’d rather defend the gate than cry after it’s breached  
- Writing code, writing poetry — same thing, just different syntax

## Projects
They aren't just codes, they're tools. Weapons. Mirrors.  
Check out what I'm building under [BitCraft Production](https://bitcraftproduction.com) — browsers, study tools, digital worlds.

## Stack? Philosophy.
- **Build fast** — but only what matters  
- **Keep it lean** — every extra line is a liability  
- **Go deep** — surface-level is for tourists

I’m not a developer who copies.  
I’m a builder who remembers why we started in the first place.
