<> Hi, I'm Ganesh Kumar </>

I don’t chase job titles.  
I build what I believe in. Break what I must. Learn what I love. Repeat.


**Right Now**
- Learning **system design** — not from tutorials, but from tearing things apart and wiring them back  
- Exploring **cyber security** — because control starts with understanding where control is lost  
- Writing **code** & **poetry** — both require rhythm, depth, and truth


**My Skills**
- **Languages**: Python, Kotlin, Rust, Dart, JavaScript, Bash  
- **Platforms**: Android (Jetpack Compose), Web (Next.js), Linux (Ubuntu lover)  
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Flutter, Firebase, Node.js, Tailwind, Git  
- **Security & Systems**: VPNs, DNS, fingerprint defense, low-level Linux tweaks  
- **Others**: Markdown, Shell scripting, Open Source, SEO, Blogging, AI APIs, Video Editing


**Projects**
They aren't just code.  
They're my voice. My vision. My rebellion.

Built under [BitCraft Production](https://bitcraftproduction.com):
- **Study Friend** — AI-powered study companion (flashcards, mindmaps, homework solver)   
- **Somix** — building a secure and minimal Android browser to rival Brave & Tor (Kotlin + Rust)  
- **Tark** — Hindi programming language, open-source and beginner-friendly  
- **BitOS** — not just an OS, a digital home for thinkers and makers


## Stack? No. Philosophy.
- **Build fast** — but only what matters  
- **Keep it lean** — every extra line is a liability  
- **Go deep** — surface-level is for tourists  
- **Respect privacy** — I don’t build spyware. I build shields.

I’m not a developer who copies.  
I’m a builder who remembers why we started in the first place.  
And I’m just getting started.
